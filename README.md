# 4 Player Chess Bot
This is a school project (2019) that was, at its heart, a userscript for chess.com providing a functioning 4-player chess bot. It communicates with a compiled c++ server that 
actually computes the move tree. In addition, it has code for performing parameter-tuning, using a custom implementation of the Glicko rating algorithm to compare bots.
See paper.docx for more.

This project no doubt needs some work to get running again, but it's pretty nifty. 

You can see a video of it in action  
[here](video.html) (the bot is blue).
